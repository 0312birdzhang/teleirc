Pull requests
=============

Make sure that the unit tests pass before submitting your pull request,
using `npm test`.

In order to keep our git log clean, please remember to squash your commits
into logical units where each commit should represent a functioning state
of the
program. Remove small one-liner fixup commits etc before submitting your
pull request. [More info](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5721879)

Thank you!
